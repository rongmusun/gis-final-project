    "text": "The New York City subway system is one of the largest and most extensive public transit networks in the world, playing a crucial role in the daily lives of millions of residents and visitors. With over 400 stations and miles of track, the subway serves as a vital lifeline for transportation across the city. While the subway network is designed to connect people to key urban areas, its effectiveness in providing access to essential public facilities such as schools remains a critical question for urban planning and policy.\nThis project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the NYC subway system in providing accessibility to schools. Schools are fundamental public facilities that require reliable and equitable access for students, teachers, and staff. By analyzing the spatial relationship between subway lines and schools, this study seeks to determine how well the subway network serves the educational needs of the city’s population.\nThe primary objective of this study is to assess the accessibility of NYC subway lines to schools by measuring the proportion of schools located within a walkable distance (0.5 miles) of a subway station. The study will also identify underserved areas and provide insights for improving transit accessibility to schools."

The observed coverage rate is due to random chance.\nAlternative Hypothesis (H1): The NYC subway system is designed to provide effective access to schools, resulting in a higher-than-random school coverage rate.\nThis hypothesis explicitly relates to second-order properties, as it evaluates the spatial relationships between two datasets:\nSubway lines (spatial features): Representing the transit infrastructure. Schools (spatial points): Representing educational facilities."

    "text": "Discussion\nObserved Pattern:\nThe clustering of schools is significant, particularly at smaller distances (r&lt;0.05). This suggests that schools tend to be located close to one another more often than would be expected under random placement.\nThe clustering of schools could be related to urban planning policies, population density, or access to infrastructure (e.g., proximity to subway lines).\nRelationship:\nStatistical Significance Both the intercept and slope are highly significant (p&lt;2e−16). The significant negative slope indicates that schools are more densely clustered closer to subway lines, supporting the Alternative Hypothesis (H₁).\nThis aligns with urban planning principles, where schools are often placed near transit hubs for accessibility.\nWhile the relationship is significant, the low R-squared suggests that factors beyond proximity to subway lines (e.g., population density, neighborhood infrastructure) also influence school clustering. ## Conclusion\nBased on the regression results:\nWe reject the Null Hypothesis (H₀) in favor of the Alternative Hypothesis (H₁). The NYC subway system significantly impacts school density, with schools clustering closer to subway lines. Although the R-squared value suggests additional factors influence school density, the relationship with subway proximity is strong and statistically significant.\nThe NYC subway system is effective in providing access to schools, as evidenced by the clustering of schools near subway lines."
